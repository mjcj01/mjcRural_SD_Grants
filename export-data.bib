Additional research is needed to understand the interconnection of rural spaces and teacher retention. The purpose of this study was to understand the perceptions of educational stakeholders in a rural region of the western United States as they relate to retaining teachers in rural school communities that are experiencing shifts in the community due to limited rural opportunity and underdevelopment, ageing populations, poverty, out-migration, and shrinking economies. The study collected data from teachers, administrators, parents, patrons, legislators, students, and other educational stakeholders through a survey instrument (n= 806). Data were collected from October of 2017 to January of 2018. The methodological approach was a mixed qualitative and quantitative inquiry. The mixed-method approach was due to several open-ended questions on the survey, along with quantitative, closed-ended survey questions. The findings illuminate the critical role leadership plays in retaining teachers, and the significant need for robust mentoring and support programs for new teachers. Findings also consider the relationship between rural education policies, leadership practices, teacher recruitment and retention, and broader issues related to rural development. In addition to finding ways to better support mentoring, there are several implications for teacher and leadership preparation programs to better support rural placements.},

Because these policy initiatives do not directly address the educational challenges experienced by disadvantaged students, they have contributed little—and are not likely to contribute much in the future—to raising overall student achievement or to reducing achievement and educational attainment gaps between advantaged and disadvantaged students. Moreover, such policies have the potential to do serious harm. Addressing the educational challenges faced by children from disadvantaged families will require a broader and bolder approach to education policy than the recent efforts to reform schools.

To address the unique challenges of rural areas, policies and practices have been designed specifically for application in places designated as “rural”. Yet what is “rural”? Some recent measures of rurality have gone beyond a dichotomous rural-urban divide conceptualization of rural communities. However, most measures still emphasize proximity to metropolitan areas and population density as the primary components of rurality. Few studies consider the critical role that services and amenities play in the life of a community. We suggest a new measure based on the concept of sustainable development that integrates measures of environmental, social, and economic resources. We present the Community Assets and Relative Rurality index for census block-groups in the coterminous United States and illustrate how this measure is consistent with existing measures of rurality yet offers additional insight into issues of sustainable rural development.},

I calculate the tax price of spending for each school district in the United States for 1972, 1982, and 1992. I find that using the actual tax prices (rather than treating school finance equalizations as events) resolves apparently conflicting evidence about the effects of equalizations on per-pupil spending. Depending on whether they impose tax prices greater than or less than one, school finance equalizations either enjoy increased spending under most equalization schemes, but they actually lose spending under the strongest schemes such as those that exist in California and New Mexico. More importantly, regardless of whether an equalization levels down or up, it should be understood as a tax system on districts' spending. I show that school finance equalization schemes have properties that are generally considered undesirable: they raise revenue on a base that is itself a function of the school finance system and they assign tax prices so that people with a high demand for education are penalized relative to otherwise identical people with the same income. I discuss some simple, familiar schemes that do not have these undesirable properties, yet can achieve similar redistribution.},

At the time of the study, all projects had been completed for at least 1 year. The four schools selected for the study ranged from a small, rural school in a geographically isolated area of the state, to a large urban high school in the state's largest city. Several themes evolved through interviews with 13 key school personnel: defining innovation, expectations vs. reality, individual project roles, technology planning and implementation, and the grant writing process. The data were collected through a variety of qualitative methods including semi-structured interviews, e-mail, review of formal documents, and observations of the settings in which the educator worked. Findings highlighted the differences in resources among large and small schools, the impact of individuals on a school's culture and instructional practice, the role of the state's educational support services in school and curriculum innovation, and the role of technology in educational practice.},

The authors employed case study methodology using a variety of data sources including document analysis, interviews, and observations. Cross-case findings revealed that the local educational leadership had effectively employed multiple instructional, distributed, and transformational practices to improve student outcomes, and had established multiple formal and informal linkages with institutional entities outside of the school to accomplish their missions. Contributors to school-wide success in each case included: focus on instruction, standards, and expectations; strengths of teachers, and; development of multiple support systems for students with varying needs. Educational leaders in the schools studied with the highest poverty rates and highest percentages of English Language Learners made significant improvements in student achievement through active involvement of parents and the mobilization of other external and community resources.

	volume = {24},
	abstract = {While there is a growing body of work that considers the implications of the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) for rural schools, literature that critically examines the policy itself is lacking in rural educational research. This critical policy analysis focuses on the highly qualified teacher provision of NCLB as it relates to rural schools. The goal of critical policy analysis is to contextualize policy within its historical and political landscape, positioning policy as reflective of a group or individual's vision of an ideal society. While the highly qualified teacher provision has been advanced as unproblematic, critical analysis of its broader context suggests a mismatch between its assumptions and the unique needs of rural schools. While undoubtedly all children deserve a highly qualified teacher, what deems a teacher to be highly qualified is a matter that is both complex and highly context-dependent. Thinking about quality teaching in rural schools invites opportunity for dialogue, yet the provision reflects a reductionist, quantifiable conceptualization of quality. The policy stifles debate about what rural communities expect from their teachers, declaring consensus about the role of subject matter knowledge to the exclusion of other factors particularly salient in rural schools. Citation: Eppley, K. (2009). Rural schools and the highly qualified teacher provision of No Child Left Behind: A critical policy analysis. Journal of Research in Rural Education, 24(4). Retrieved [date] from http://jrre.psu.edu/articles/24-4.pdf Recently, I talked with a teacher who began her career in a rural school. She currently teaches in a less rural setting, and when I asked her how her work was different then, she immediately identified the importance of helping children see how they fit within the larger world. She made clear that successful teaching in a rural school is different than successful teaching in other settings. She even suggested that if the rural teacher does not understand this, her students will not learn. She did not mention anything about standardized testing or the role of teacher certifications as factors important to what makes a teacher highly qualified for rural schools. Rather, in her rural school, successful teaching required that she worked as a mediator between the curriculum and the lived experiences of the children in her classroom. Her students were deeply rooted in the immediate community, having extensive generational ties and few opportunities to travel beyond the nearest town. Because of this, it was essential that she both understand the children's relationship with their place and, simultaneously, use her adult point of view to help them understand their relationship with their larger world. She was certain that if both of these conditions weren't met, learning would not occur. The quality teaching this teacher describes falls outside of the parameters outlined in the highly qualified teacher provision of the 2001 federal No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB). Further, she suggests that reducing quality teaching to characteristics that can be standardized and quantified would be counterproductive for rural schools. This critical policy analysis of the highly qualified teacher provision of NCLB will extend this argument. Analyzing the highly qualified teacher provision with critical policy analysis enables contextualization of the policy within its historical and political landscape, positioning policy as reflective of a group or individual's vision of an ideal society. Critical Policy Analysis: An Introduction Critical policy analysis is an examination of policy in which policy is positioned as the outcome of historical and social contexts and power relations (Edmondson, 2004; Taylor, 1997). Such analysis looks closely at a policy's origins and consequences with an eye toward justice and equity. Thus, it is overtly political work; it should originate from a moral and ethical stance (Prunty, 1985). …},

The research drew upon interviews and survey results from rural Colorado as well as from a comparison group of non-rural school districts in the state.

Using a state‐level panel dataset from 1992 to 2009, I find states that imposed binding school district TELs have at least 4.3 percent point higher state shares of total education funding relative to states without binding school district TELs after the passage of NCLB. This suggests state governments intervened by increasing funding assistance to school districts. NCLB was a fiscal shock to state governments’ finances and this shock was an unintended consequence of the interaction between binding school district TELs and an underfunded federal mandate.

	abstract = {The Race to the Top fund (RTT) is intended to be a major federal investment in state and local education capacity and systemic education reforms aligned with federal policy priorities. In coming years, questions will be asked about the extent to which investments made through the RTT grant program improve educational productivity and effectiveness. This article establishes a baseline profile for how states and localities intend to invest federal RTT funds. The authors’ initial look at states’ RTT budgets provides an early indication of the amounts and types of investments in public education that are likely to result from the RTT program as well as raises critical questions for consideration in future evaluations of the RTT grant program.},

	abstract = {Utilizing critical geography, critical history, and critical educational studies as guideposts, this article examines community organizing and school district partnerships as relevant to improving urban public education reform efforts and schooling practices within the United States. Proceeding in four parts, part one discusses the kinds of external multi-sector entities working with school districts in a continued era of accountability-driven educational reform. Understanding community activism as a lever to address urban geospatial obstacles to equity-oriented educational practices, this is followed by a historical overview of community-based organizations (CBOs) as tied to sociopolitical, economic, and schooling transformation throughout the U.S. Part three helps to illustrate this position through discussion of the Buffalo-Niagara Region and the case of one urban school district context—Buffalo Public Schools (BPS). Specifically, it considers how regional history, demographic shifts, urban development, racial spatialization, and CBOs affect district practices. It concludes with a discussion of the significance of CBO partnerships with urban schools toward the end of improving educational opportunities for traditionally underserved, low income, and minoritized student populations.},
